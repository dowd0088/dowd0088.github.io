           <h2>About Me</h2> 
           <article>
            <p>My name is Georgia, though I go by George and I grew up in Ottawa Ontario. From my early years I enjoyed many of the art forms i'm now taking in this course, from the digital aspects to the physical ones. I've also shared a love for programing, <strong>specifically the more less complicated types...</strong> but overall I enjoy working with code in my spare time. I also really enjoy photography, as for me it's a way to freeze memories in time. Even so, an image can never convey the emotions of said memory, which is a concept that facinates me.</p>
            <p>I'd originally tried out two alternative programs here, that being the computer science and technician ones. Though I did learn a lot, <em>and developed a special hatred for network systems</em> I relized that I wanted to explore a program with more artistic opportunities as opposed to technical ones. Since starting this program on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of September I've found this program and it's courses to be right up my alley. I'm excited for what's to come and hope to give everything my all for these upcoming 2 years!</p>

        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Art:</strong> I really enjoy art in all different forms, from digital to traditional. I also enjoy more specific forms of it, like making collages and scrapbooking. One of the reasons why I chose this program was because of the different art opportunities I could explore.</li>
            <li><strong>Video Games:</strong> From a young age I've found myself playing basically ever nintendo game known to man (mostly thanks to my father), in todays time I still find comfort in playing many different genres whenever I have the time to do so. Specifically I really enjoy rpg and cosy games like Animal Crossing, and shooter games like COD and Overwatch.</li>
